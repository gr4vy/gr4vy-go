    In Gr4vy, a buyer represents your customer, the shopper who's performing
    a checkout and making a purchase.

    A buyer can be used by you to:

    * Display a human readable name (`display_name`) for a buyer in the Gr4vy
    admin panel
    * Associate multiple tokenized payment methods with a single user
    * Initialize **Gr4vy Embed** with the buyer ID, automatically displaying the
      buyer's previously stored payment methods, allowing for faster checkout.
  name: Buyers
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a card rule defines how a card transaction is processed. It
    determines which payment services are used, and with what priority, based
    on the transaction amount, card type, and many more attributes.
  name: Card Rules
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment method represents a way in which a payment can be
    processed, for example a card payment, a PayPal payment, or a Bitcoin
    payment.

    The payment method API can be used to:

    * List all the available payment methods
    * Filter the available payment method for a buyer in a specific currency
    and country.
    * Store (also known as tokenize) a payment method for a buyer.
    * Fetch all previously tokenized payment methods for a buyer.
  name: Payment Methods
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment option represents a list of methods (card, PayPal,
    etc) that are available for a given locale.

    The payment options API can be used to:

    * Determine what types of payments can be processed in a specific locale.
    * Display a list options to a buyer to choose from.
  name: Payment Options
- description: |-
    Payment service definitions describe the fields required for a payment
    service to be configured.
  name: Payment Service Definitions
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment service represents a configured payment provider
    (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, etc) for a specific payment type (card, bitcoin,
    etc)

    The payment services API can be used to:

    * Provide Gr4vy with the payment credentials for a payment provider.
    * Set a display name for a payment provider.
  name: Payment Services
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a transaction represents a payment in any state, either before it
    is authorized, once it is captured, or after it has been refunded.

    The transactions API can be used to:

    - Authorize, capture, and store cards.
    - Authorize, capture, and store alternative payment methods like PayPal.
    - Refund, void, and otherwise cancel existing transactions.

        Attempts to create an authorization for a payment method. In some cases it is
        not possible to create the authorization without redirecting the user for
        their authorization. In these cases the status is set to
        `buyer_approval_pending` and an `approval_url` is returned.

        Additionally, this endpoint accepts a few additional fields that allow for
        simultaneous capturing and storage of the payment method.

        * `store` - Use this field to store the payment method for
        future use. Not all payment methods support this feature.
        * `capture` - Use this method to also perform a capture of the transaction
        after it has been authorized.
