    In Gr4vy, a buyer represents your customer, the shopper who's performing
    a checkout and making a purchase.

    A buyer can be used by you to:

    * Display a human readable name (`display_name`) for a buyer in the Gr4vy
    admin panel
    * Associate multiple tokenized payment methods with a single user
    * Initialize **Gr4vy Embed** with the buyer ID, automatically displaying the
      buyer's previously stored payment methods, allowing for faster checkout.

    A Checkout Session represents the session of a user as they progress
    through an online checkout.
  name: Checkout Sessions

    In Gr4vy, a digital wallet represents a way for a buyer to pay using
    card details already stored on their device via a digital wallet service
    such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. The buyer will not have to fill in their
    card details on checkout.

    The digital wallets API can be used to:

    * Register with a digital wallet provider.
    * List digital wallets currently registered.
  name: Digital Wallets
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment method token represents the token created by a payment
    service for a payment method.

    The payment method token API can be used to:

    * List all the available tokens for a payment method
    * Use these tokens to make direct API calls to that payment service,
    without the need to go through Gr4vy.
  name: Payment Method Tokens
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment method represents a way in which a payment can be
    processed, for example a card, a PayPal account, or a bank account.

    The payment method API can be used to:

    * List all the available payment methods
    * Filter the available payment method for a buyer in a specific currency
    and country.
    * Store (also known as tokenize) a payment method for a buyer.
    * Fetch all previously tokenized payment methods for a buyer.
  name: Payment Methods
- description: Payment Method definitions provide display information to a payment
    method.
  name: Payment Method Definitions
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment option represents a list of methods (card, PayPal,
    etc) that are available for a given locale.

    The payment options API can be used to:

    * Determine what types of payments can be processed in a specific locale.
    * Display a list options to a buyer to choose from.
  name: Payment Options
- description: |-
    Payment service definitions describe the fields required for a payment
    service to be configured.
  name: Payment Service Definitions
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a payment service represents a configured payment provider
    (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, etc) for a specific payment type (card, bitcoin,
    etc)

    The payment services API can be used to:

    * Provide Gr4vy with the payment credentials for a payment provider.
    * Set a display name for a payment provider.
  name: Payment Services
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a report represents the configuration details to extract or
    dump a set of data into a downloadable CSV file. The data extracted
    by a report is configured via the reports API where you can specify:

    * Which fields should be in the dataset.
    * How the dataset should be sorted.
    * How the dataset should be filtered.

    Once a report is created, it may be executed on a one-off or recurring
    basis. One-off reports are executed only once shortly after the report
    is created, while recurring reports are executed periodically based on
    its configured frequency, e.g. weekly or monthly.

    During a report execution, the data is extracted and loaded into
    a CSV file according to the report's configuration. The resulting file
    may then be downloaded.

    The reports API can be used to:

    * Create and configure new reports.
    * List all reports.
    * View the configuration details of a report.
    * List a report's executions.
    * Reconfigure an existing report.
    * Generate a temporary URL to download the result of a report execution
    in CSV format.
  name: Reports
- description: |-
    In Gr4vy, a transaction represents a payment in any state, either before it
    is authorized, once it is captured, or after it has been refunded.

    The transactions API can be used to:

    - Authorize, capture, and store cards.
    - Authorize, capture, and store alternative payment methods like PayPal.
    - Refund, void, and otherwise cancel existing transactions.

        Attempts to create an authorization for a payment method. In some cases it is
        not possible to create the authorization without redirecting the user for
        their authorization. In these cases the status is set to
        `buyer_approval_pending` and an `approval_url` is returned.

        Additionally, this endpoint accepts a few additional fields that allow for
        simultaneous capturing and storage of the payment method.

        * `store` - Use this field to store the payment method for
        future use. Not all payment methods support this feature.
        * `capture` - Use this method to also perform a capture of the transaction
        after it has been authorized.

    CartItem:
      description: |-
        A cart item that represents a single cart line item for a transaction.
        Note that some optional properties are required for certain payment
        service providers. If no value is set for these properties, we will use
        their default value.

        If the total due to be paid for the item is required by the payment service
        provider, generally referred to as the "total amount", the formula below
        will usually be used to calculate this amount:

        `(unit_amount * quantity) - discount_amount + tax_amount`

        It's highly recommended that the total amount to pay for all items
        should match the transaction's amount to reduce the risk of the
        transaction being declined by the payment service provider.
      example:
        tax_amount: 0
        external_identifier: item-789123

            Please note that this amount is for the total of the cart item and not

            should be the total discount amount for 5 of the cart item.

            You might see unexpected failed transactions if the `discount_amount` can
            not be equally divided by the `quantity` value. This is due to the fact
            that some payment services require this amount to be specified per unit.

            In this situation we recommend splitting this item into separate items,
            each with their own specific discount.

        The specific usage of these fields will depend on the capabilities of
        the underlying PSP and bank. As a typical example, 'name' and
        'description' could be concatenated using '* ' as a separator, and
        then the resulting descriptor would be truncated to 22 characters by
        the issuing bank.
